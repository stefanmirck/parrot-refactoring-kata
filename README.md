# Parrot Refactoring Kata

Can you spot any code smells in this code? Here’s a clue: a spot of Pol(l)ymorphism should improve matters!

Refactor this code, take small steps, run the tests often. See how small and beautiful and polymorphic you can make it.

## Acknowlegements

This kata is based on [@emilybache](https://github.com/emilybache "emilybache (Emily Bache)")’s [original kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Parrot-Refactoring-Kata) and [@keriati](https://github.com/keriati "keriati (Attila Kerekes)")’s translation to JavaScript, but instead is an ECMAScript module (no transpiling) and uses the Node.js test runner (no dependencies). Watch Emily’s [videos](https://youtu.be/UxNEHKg_2eA "Conditional to Polymorphism Refactoring Practice") [explaining](https://youtu.be/IvFX8Ivit1k "Nail the Parrot Refactoring Kata in C#") [this](https://youtu.be/7IT6c8wwHs4 "Power Up Your Java OO Design Skills") [kata](https://youtu.be/pO_5DQ3vDtc "Smooth Python OO design and coding success").

The code is heavily inspired by one of the examples in Martin Fowler’s book “Refactoring”. It‘s a classic, and if it‘s not on your bookshelf already treat yourself to a copy.
